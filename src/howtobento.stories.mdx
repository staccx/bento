# How to use Bento
Here we'll got through how to get your app up and runnning with Bento.

## Installation
We often start with a fresh [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) template, but this is not a requirement. We also have a bento-template for create-react-app that does everything for you. If this is your first time setting up a fresh Bento project, we suggest doing it manually or at least looking throught what the cra-template actually does.
If you use the cra-template, you should create your own theme as described below.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template bento
```

## Manual installation
Bento has peer dependencies to styled-components, so we'll have to install that as well as Bento itself.

#### Yarn
```bash
yarn add styled-components @staccx/bento
```

#### NPM
```bash
npm install --save styled-components @staccx/bento
```

NOTE: _These come preinstalled with the cra-template_

### Create your theme
Bento is pretty ugly without a theme. If you've ever tried to get Boostrap to not look like Bootstrap, you'll appreciate why.
Create a js-file to hold your theme. For example at `/src/theme/theme.js`.

<details><summary>theme.js example</summary>
<p>

```js
import { css } from "styled-components"
import { theming } from "@staccx/bento"

const reset = theming.createGlobal({
  baseReset: theming.cssResets
})

const borderRadius = "0px"
const headerHeight = "70px"

const targetSize = {
  small: "36px",
  normal: "44px"
}

const wrapper = {
  small: "460px",
  medium: "720px",
  large: "1158px",
  huge: "1440px",
  breakout: "640px"
}

const spacing = {
  grid: "7vh",
  huge: "96px",
  largePlus: "72px",
  large: "48px",
  mediumPlus: "32px",
  medium: "24px",
  small: "12px",
  tiny: "6px",
  flush: "0"
}

const color = {
  bg: "#F4F2F1",
  primary: "#0000A0",
  primaryLight: "#DCEDFF",
  secondary: "#FDECE4",
  gray: "#646464",
  text: "#000040",
  white: "#fff",
  link: "#0000A0",
  red: "#FC6161",
  yellow: "#FFE184",
  line: "#C9C7C7",
  wcag: "#777",
  disabled: "#E4E4E4",
  warning: "#FC6161",
  black: "#000",
  subtleHover: "#EDF2F7"
}

const font = {
  h1: "32px",
  h2: "26px",
  h3: "22px",
  h4: "18px",
  h5: "16px",
  h6: "14px",
  base: "14px"
}

const fontWeight = {
  bold: "700",
  normal: "400"
}

const webfonts = {
  google: {
    families: [
      "Montserrat:400,500,600,700"
    ]
  }
}

const fontFamily = {
  heading: "Montserrat",
  body: "Montserrat"
}

theming.theme.append(
    {
      name: "My theme",
      font,
      fontWeight,
      webfonts,
      color,
      wrapper,
      targetSize,
      borderRadius,
      headerHeight,
      fontFamily,
      spacing,
      reset
    }
  )
```

</p>
</details>

But it is suggested to split each part into its own file

<details>
<summary>theme.color.js summary</summary>
<p>

```js
import {theming} from "@staccx/bento"

theming.theme.append({
  color: {
      bg: "#F4F2F1",
      primary: "#0000A0",
      primaryLight: "#DCEDFF",
      secondary: "#FDECE4",
      gray: "#646464",
      text: "#000040",
      white: "#fff",
      link: "#0000A0",
      red: "#FC6161",
      yellow: "#FFE184",
      line: "#C9C7C7",
      wcag: "#777",
      disabled: "#E4E4E4",
      warning: "#FC6161",
      black: "#000",
      subtleHover: "#EDF2F7"
  }
})
```

</p>
</details>

and so on. Just remeber to import everything into your theme

theme.js
```js
import "./theme.color"
```
and that's it. No need to use it anywhere, it just _is_.

## Multi theme support
the `theming` namespace in bento exports `themes` which contains all the themes that are created.

If you use the second parameter for the component's `createVariants` function, you will write to that theme

Single theme (or default use)

```js
import {Button} from "@staccx/bento"

Button.createVariants({
  button: {
    primary: css`background-color: blue;`
  }
})
```

will create a variant for `Button`'s themeProps `button` called primary on the _default theme_

```js
Button.createVariants({
  button: {
    primary: css`background-color: blue;`
  }
}, "themename")
```

will create the same variant in a theme called `themename`.

# Usage in app
Then we need to import our theme into our app and make it accessible to all the components. This is done by using the theme-provider. This handles the usage of our theme and enables WebFonts and GlobalStyle for us.



```js
import React from "react"
import { ThemeProvider, Button, CheckBox } from "@staccx/bento"

function App () {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <>
        <Button onClick={() => console.log("Something")}>This is a button</Button>
        <CheckBox id={"test"}>Tester</CheckBox>
      </>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```



#### Eslint
Here at @staccx we have our own eslint-config based on standardjs and prettier. Please use that, installation procedures will be located at that repo.

# Creating variants
Every component has a default variant. Unless a different variant is supplied, the default will be used. You can, and should add your own styles to the default variants if you want your app to look good.

Components have their own themeProps. These props allow you to add styles to the different HTML-elements that make up a component. Some components (like Button) only have one, while others (like CheckBox) have more. When you supply a variant to a component, that variant will be applied to all parts of the component, and can be targeted through themeProps.

Let's start by modifying the defaults for an Input. Generally, we put all the variants for a component in one file. Start by creating a new file, for example in `/src/theme/variants/input.variants.js`.

Heres an example of new defaults for an input:

```bash
import { css } from "styled-components"
import {Input, theming} from "@staccx/bento"

Input.createVariants(
  {
  input: {
    [theming.VARIANT_DEFAULT]: css`
      transition: border 0.2s ease, box-shadow 0.2s ease;

      &:hover,
      &:focus {
        background-color: ${theming.color.white};
      }

      &:hover {
        border-color: ${theming.color.primary};
      }

      &:focus {
        box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px ${theming.color.primary};
      }

      &[disabled] {
        background-color: ${theming.color("bgGray")};
        cursor: not-allowed;

        &:hover {
          border-color: ${color.line};
        }
      }
    `
  }}
)
```

Now we have our variant, but we need to add that variant to your theme. Go to your theme file, import your variant and add it to the theme like so:

Create an index file in each folder so that the imports are kept "clean".js

```js
import "./input.variants"
import "./button.variants"
//etc
```

and then in `theme/index.js`
```js
import "./variants" //Import your variants

//thats it. If its importet it is registered.
```

# How to use Bento's storybook?
Each component has documentation on how to use it with code examples, and information that is nice to know. However, in order to keep Bento up to date we all have a responsibility to adjust and add new components to the Bento library.

If there is documentation that is unclear or does not make any sense, do fix it or ask some of your teammembers to help you make it understandable for all. Remember that we document all our source code in the English language to increase the readability for all members of the team.

For example, if you come across two components almost looking the same and does almost the same, you should seek to generalise those two components into one. Then you can use for example props to customize the component to do the same job. That way, Bento will have components
that is specific for its purpose, and we can focus on improving components rather than rewriting common patterns.

## How to create a story for a component
In the root of this repository, there is a folder called `.storybook`, and inside that folder you can find the file called `template.stories.mdx`.
That file is a template for you to use when creating new stories in Bento.
Then go to the folder of the component you want to write a story for and create a file called `ComponentName.stories.mdx`.  Good luck!
